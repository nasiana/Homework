NOTE:
To whoever is marking this, I am honestly really sorry about the quality of
this HW. I did actually try with this but my weaknesses are anything written
like this kind of thing. I am also extremely weak at anything 
business-orientated and largely written.

I really did try but I struggled a lot with this HW.

Also, I don't mind getting a low grade. I've stopped caring about the grades
I get; at the end of the day I'm here to learn - not to get all the marks :)

I know it's not protocol to release answers, but I really hope I am not the 
only one who struggled massively with this HW and that this experience may be
more common with others too. So it may be a good idea to release some super
good answers to this questions :) Obviously just an idea, I know it has been
standard protocol to not release anything, but I feel like it could be 
beneficial to others.

Thanks for reading ! and sorry for this HW !

TASK 1 (Agile Techniques

# Question 1
Complete definitions for Scrum related key terminology provided below.

SCRUM CEREMONIES 

·        Product backlog refinement

Working with the Scrum teams and stakeholders (when appropriate) so that the 
Product Backlog items are in a ‘ready state’, is the goal of  Product backlog 
refinement. 

This essentially translates into the idea that the development team has the
idea that an item is: of enough coherency that it is understandeable what the
stakeholders are requesting and why they are requesting it & appropriately small 
so that the items are small enough that it is feasible to complete them within
a sprint (generally a few days of work) to satisfy with the definition of done.

·        Sprint planning.

This is attended by the scrum master, product owner, and development team. It is
rare but outside stakeholders may attend by invitation. The goals of this meeting
are the sprint goal and sprint backlog. During this meeting, the product owner 
outlines the highest priority items in the product backlog.

·        Daily scrum.

Daily brief meeting where the entire team meets to discuss their work from the 
previous day, their plan of action today and any obstacles that are
delaying them or the team from meeting the Sprint goal. This meeting should be
maximum 15 minutes.

SOURCE:
CFG course materials

·        Sprint review.

This meeting is open to anyone: the team, Product Owner, Scrum Master, 
stakeholders, management, customers, etc. The attendees are shown a
working product of what the team managed to complete during the Sprint.

The team only show items that satisfy the criteria of the 
“definition of done”. Generally, this is an informal meeting.

·        Sprint retrospective

This meeting follows the sprint review meeting. The parts of the
scrum process that went right, wrong, and what could have gone better are 
reveiwed by the team. 

This meeting provides the team the opportunity to be able to improve future 
sprints and projects from reviewing and learning from both mistakes and 
successes.

SCRUM ROLES

·        ScrumMaster

This is the individual who is responsible for the Scrum framework, ensuring that 
it is utilized correctly and maximizing its benefits.

SOURCE:
CFG course materials

·        Product Owner

The maintenance of the Product Backlog whilst representing the interests of the
stakeholders and verifying the value of the work the Development Team does, 
is the responsibility of this individual.

SOURCE:
CFG course materials

·        Development Team.

This team consists of a cross-functional group of people in charge of the job of 
delivering potentially shippable increments of product at the conclusion of 
every Sprint.

#Question 2

'''
You are leading a development team that was given a task to create a new yoga booking system.

High level description of the system is as follows:
 
·        It has a very simple interface to accept user input (bookings) and display classes information

·        All bookings, appointments, schedules etc should be stored in a SQL database.

·        There is a ‘backend’ system that should be written in Python to handle the logic and manage the data flow. 

Your team has two weeks to build a simple prototype that will be shown to the client to seek their feedback and discuss further enhancements.

'''

TASKS:

# It is important that Task 1 - Task 5 be performed in that order, as they are
reliant on tasks executed in the one prior.

Task 1:
Create the very simple user interface 

Task 2:
Create the code to accept user input (bookings)

Task 3:
Create the code to display classes information

Task 4:
Create the neccessary Python code so that All bookings, appointments, schedules 
etc should be stored in a SQL database

Task 5:
Corroborate the Python code with the SQL database. Also, this point is a good
point to verify any further code that may need to be written in MySQL.

#Tasks 6 - 9 can be performed in paralell with one another 

Task 6:
Write the skeleton code for the ‘backend’ system that should be written in 
Python to handle the logic and manage the data flow

Task 7:
Write the complete Python code that pertains to Python element of the project

Task 8:
Write the complete Python code that pertains to the MySQL element of the 
project (MySQL database etc)

Task 9:
Write the complete code for the ‘backend’ system that should be written in 
Python to handle the logic and manage the data flow. This should be a 
combination of codes from Tasks 6-8. Although all these codes can be performed
silmutaneously as there may be many changes and sprints needed.

TASK 2 (SQL)

Design a cinema booking system.
'''

# Draw a list of key requirements:

Users are able to choose seats and are not locked into any arrangement
immediately until they have completed their transaction.

Users are able to go back and refresh

Users are able to modify the seating and movies in a smooth manner

Once they have committed their cinema booking, this is locked in and the
relevant seats are now no longer available for further users

Users are able to book multiple seats, as they may be booking for their friends

Data is updated in real-time as many users could be booking silmuatenously

Have neccessary protocols to handle many requests as there could be time 
intervals where lots of users are using the site at once so need to make sure
that the site does not crash.

Give users the option to delete their reservations and update this in real 
time

# What are your main considerations?

Data updating in real time i.e. seats need to be updated as approriate
as many users could be using the booking system at once. You don't want to
accidenntally book the same seat for multiple users.

Providing users with flexibility with these bookings i.e. as long as it is after
a limited time period after doing their booking ; they are able to cancel 
requests

The fact that use of the system is very time-dependant, there may be times 
where there are lots of requests at once for like a super popular movie like a
Psychological thriller (i love psychological thrillers :D)

The stochastic nature of the users; maybe by looking at the seating arrangements
this may alter what the user wants and what movie the user wants to see i.e. 
if a user is set on good seats but can't find good seats for their desired
movie, this may change the movie they want to see. (I hope I used stochastic
right here, I studied stochastic and deterministic models amongst other models
during my degree and this context is very different lol but the word seemed 
fitting here)

# What would be your common or biggest problems?

There being too many requests at a time and thus overloading the servers
and causing the website to crash.

Data not being updated in real time so several users may have booked the 
same seat accidentally.

Data not being committed to the databases, again so users think they have 
booked seats but this transaction wasn't committed.

# What components or tools would you potentially use?

The transaction/rollback/commit features from MySQL.

Multiple servers to be able to handle if there are lots of requests at once.

Batching of data 

Scheduling of data
